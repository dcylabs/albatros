	<b>Docker</b> is widely used to build, ship and run applications or services. <br/>
	This docker image is (and will remain) an open-source container that provide a <b> secure </b> WebUI that helps you to manage your Docker daemon from everywhere. <br/>
	It also comes with a <b> free </b> android application that is more user friendly for those who wants to use it through their smartphones.  <br/>
	For <b> Apple </b> users, there is <b>no</b> mobile application planned at the moment because I do not have the hardware to work on it.  <br/>
